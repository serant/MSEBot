How to use github:

Adding a repository from online to your computer

Updating your changes

Whenever you make a change, you have to save the Arduino file, then go to terminal and type 

git status

the file you changed should show up in red

git add -A
git commit -m”your message”
git push

and your changes will be pushed onto the branch you have checked out

Everything about branches

the project has several branches. whenever you push your changes, you push the changes to the branch you’re currently on; not the entire project.

to view branches

git branch

to switch branches

git checkout **type branch name**

after you have checked out a branch, whenever you push your changes it will go onto that branch
